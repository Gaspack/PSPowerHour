* **Title**: What's New in the World of Toast?
* **Abstract**: There's a new version of BurntToast on the horizon, with a couple of new features that are worthy of a quick demo. Be one of the first to see the latest cutting edge developments in the world of toast (on Windows)... and maybe a sneak peek of a new community effort to develop a cross-platform notification module.
